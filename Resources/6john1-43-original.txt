Be it enacted by His Most Gracious and Excellent Majesty as follows:-
1.   This Act shall be known as the Interpretation (Treaties and Conventions) Act, 2023, Bill T6211.
2.   Treaties, conventions, and other like agreements, will be published after primary legislation, and are to be considered secondary legislation.
3.   These treaties, et cetera, shall follow similar citation rules to Acts of Parliament:
 a)   Regnal year as described in the Calendar Act, 3 John 1 c. 30.
 b)   Chapter number, in uppercase roman numerals, following ‘c.’
 c)   An example is 3 John 1 c. I (Abbreviated form)
 d)   The citation may be read as the First [Treaty/Convention/Agreement/etc] of the Statute of the Parliamentary Session that sat in the Third Year of the Reign of King John I. (Long form)
 e)   Treaties, et cetera, are usually referred to by name. (Named form)
4.   On certain treaties, et cetera, relating to a person, the pronoun he and him are to be understood as any human: male, female, etc.
5.   The named form is most commonly used, but all forms may be used in any legislation.
6.   These do not have a short form like Acts of Parliament, as the form can cause confusion on which type of legislation is the referred document.
