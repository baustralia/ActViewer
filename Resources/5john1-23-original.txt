CHAPTER 23 - AN ACT TO AMEND THE SECOND CHAPTER OF THE STATUTE OF PARLIAMENT THAT SAT DURING THE FIFTH YEAR OF THE REIGN OF KING JOHN I, COMMONLY CALLED THE NATIONAL ROUTES ACT, TO UPDATE THE PATTERN OF ROUTE SIGNS TO BE MORE APPEALING TO BAUSTRALIANS, AND FOR PURPOSES CONNECTED THEREWITH

Be it enacted by His Most Gracious and Excellent Majesty, and with the Consent of the Current Commons assembled, the following:-
1.   This Act shall be known as the Popular Route Sign Act, 2022, C-52.
2.   Route shields in Baustralia originally consisted of the design of the Holderton Provincial Routes. A public referendum was held, where it was determined that the former shield for Mild Pond Provincial Routes was more popular.
3.   All route shields in Baustralia shall be replaced with the Mild Pond sign, with the pond graphic being replaced by a Baustralian fish.
 a)   Section 4 of the National Routes Act shall be amended to read: “All route shields shall be removed and replaced with the Mild Pond pattern sign, with a Baustralian fish replacing the pond.”
 b)   Section 5 of the National Routes Act shall be amended to read: “Each route sign to be posted shall measure 13 5/16” × 17 3/4”, or 26 9/16” × 35 7/16" for large signs.”
4.   Additionally, spur routes shall cease to use suffixes, and will now be signed identically to their parent, with an additional unique banner plate above.
5.   Routes are recommended to be designated a decommissioned route number from before the route sign change, as disambiguation shall be through route marker design.
 a)   Highway 33 Business will be redesignated Highway 6.
 b)   As these numbers are used up, and all route numbers in the next section are used up, the system shall go back to not using decommissioned numbers to avoid confusion.
 c)   Priority highway numbers are:-
	   Highways 10, 11, 26, 27, 29, 31, 32, 37, 39, 40, 44, 47, 54.
