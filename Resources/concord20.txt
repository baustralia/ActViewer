Signed at Concord, 26 January 2020.

Whereas, the Sacrée Republic has granted the Kingdom of Baustralia the Fox Islands, which conflicts with the land claims of Kapreburg, the group of two islands shall be split equally between the northern and southern halves.

1.   Baustralia shall use the northern island as their colony, and Kapreburg the southern half
2.   These land claims are agreed to by both parties, who both recognize that claiming the other half is an Act of War, and is annexation

Signed,
(John IRI)   (J.R. Morris)
