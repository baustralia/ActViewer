SCHEDULE

11 September 2022

WHEREAS the throne of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland has passed onto His Royal Highness Prince Charles Philip Arthur George to become His Majesty Charles III by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of His other Realms and Territories King, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith, and that the Crown used on emblems and other designs may be changed from a representation of the Saint Edward's Crown to the Tudor Crown, I have decided upon a crown to replace the Tudor Crown used on Baustralian armorials.
The new crown will be based upon the Imperial State Crown of the United Kingdom, with a purple cap, it shall be chased as jewelled but not actually gemmed, the monde will be blue, and the cross atop will hang pearls from the top and extremities of the cross, corners, as well as at the cross-point. The arches shall be perfectly round, and not bent.
By the power as described in My Royal Prerogative, this proclamation will be set into effect immediately.
JOHN I.R.
