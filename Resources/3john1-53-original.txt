CHAPTER 53 - AN ACT TO PROVIDE FOR THE BINDING OF LAW UPON HIS MOST GRACIOUS AND EXCELLENT MAJESTY, HIS HEIRS AND SUCCESSORS, AND FOR PURPOSES CONNECTED THEREWITH

Whereas, by the current legal system of Baustralia, His Most Gracious and Excellent Majesty the King is immune from law, be it enacted by His Most Gracious and Excellent Majesty with the consent of the present Commons assembled, providing for binding of law upon His Majesty, the following:-

PREFACE

1.   This Act shall be known as the Monarchy (Immunity) Act, 2020.
2.   Provisions of this Act referring to His Majesty the King extend also to the Heirs and Successors of His Majesty, Kings and Queens of the Kingdom of Baustralia.
3.   Whereas the Crown is the source of all justice, and the figure authorizing the courts to adjudicate, the Crown has traditionally been immune to the law.

5.   Styles of cause shall take the form “Parl. v. Rex” for male monarchs, and “Parl. v. R.” for female monarchs. 
6.   All Acts that bind His Majesty must be explicitly marked.
