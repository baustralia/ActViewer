CHAPTER 18 - AN ACT TO ESTABLISH NEW LAWS CONCERNING SUCCESSION TO THE BAUSTRALIAN THRONE

Be it enacted by His Most Gracious and Excellent Majesty, and with the Consent of the Current Commons assembled, the following:-
1.   This Act will be referred to as the Succession Law (Modifications) Act, C691, 2022.
2.   All preceding Acts concerning succession to the Baustralian throne are repealed.
3.   The right of succession to the throne of Baustralia is vested in the legitimate biological descendants of John, Duke of Kingston, issued in direct line of descent. In this connection, older siblings and their descendants have precedence over younger siblings and their descendants.
4.   A member of the Royal Family with princely status may not marry unless the Government has given its consent thereto upon an application from the monarch. Should an individual with princely status marry without such consent, they forfeit the right of succession for themself, their children, and their descendants.
5.   The heir to the throne may not undertake travel abroad without the knowledge and consent of the monarch.
6.   A member of the Royal Family with princely status may not become the sovereign ruler of a foreign state whether by election, succession, or marriage without the consent of the monarch and Parliament. Should this occur, neither they nor their descendants will be entitled to succeed to the throne of Baustralia.
7.   If the monarch has no heir, they may, with the consent of Parliament, appoint an heir of their choosing.
