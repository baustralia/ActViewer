CHAPTER 12 - AN ACT TO PREVENT ACTS OF PARLIAMENT FROM TAKING EFFECT FROM A TIME PRIOR TO THE PASSING THEREOF

Be it enacted by His Most Gracious and Excellent Majesty and by the consent of the Commons as follows:-
1.   As it is legal fiction that a session of Parliament lasts one day, Acts without a set date by containing the words "This Act shall come into effect immediately, that is, upon Royal Assent", "This Act shall come into effect on [x date]" or "This Act shall come into effect on [y event]", Acts may be considered in effect on the first day of the session, therefore someone charged with a crime may fall under injustice by being held accountable by an Act passed after the crime took place provided it took place in one session.
2.   The time an Act of Parliament receives the royal assent, which shall be its commencement, where no other is provided. This applies to future and past Acts.
3.   This Act may be known as the Acts of Parliament (Commencement) Act, 2019
4.   This Act shall come into effect immediately.
