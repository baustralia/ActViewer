On January 16, in the year two-thousand twenty, the Kingdom of Baustralia and the Empire of Kapreburg shall enter into formal mutual relations between both nation-states.
1.   Once both parties have signed this document, the Kingdom of Baustralia and the Empire of Kapreburg will officially recognize each other as an independent, sovereign nation-state, free from their macronations rule. Both parties will also unilaterally endorse the governments of each nation to show camaraderie in time of turmoil and unrest if necessary.
2.   Both parties will have the right to nullify this treaty at anytime if relations between the parties fail. If this treaty is nullified, it will need to be renewed between both parties that sign this treaty.
(J.R. Morris) (John I.R.I.)
