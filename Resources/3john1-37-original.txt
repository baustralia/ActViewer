CHAPTER 37 - AN ACT TO PROVIDE FOR THE ALTERATION OF THE ROYAL STYLE AND TITLES

Be it enacted by the King's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows :—

Whereas the present style and titles are, in the Latin tongue, "Iohannes, I Dei Gratia Baustralia, terrarum quae in ditione sunt Baustralia Rex, Ostrei Imperator" and in the English tongue. "John I, by the grace of God of Baustralia, the Dominions King, Emperor of Ostreum";
And whereas we have received a recommendation from the representatives of our Governments, in conference assembled that our style and titles should he altered as in manner hereinafter appearing:
We have thought fit to modify the Royal Style to remove the reference to the Dominions in the Latin tongue to read, “Iohannes, I Dei Gratia Baustralia, terrarum quae in ditione sunt Baustralia Rex, Ostrei Imperator”, that is the same as present;
And in the English tongue, “John I, by the grace of God of Baustralia King, Emperor of Ostreum”
