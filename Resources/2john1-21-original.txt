CHAPTER 21 - AN ACT REGARDING THE BOERC AND THE MEASURES TO BE CHANGE THE VALUE BASED ON GOLD IF THE SPOT PRICE OF SILVER FAILS

PREFACE

1.   Whereas His Majesty wishes not for the failure of the Boerc to affect the economy a great deal, this Act will lay out the measures to take.
2.   This Act shall be cited as the Boerc Measures Act, 2019.
3.   In the United Kingdom, the pound sterling reduced in price when gold was taking the place of silver. This made the silver coins token coins, and as such, the face value was not the same as the value of the metal.

CURRENT STANDARD

4.   The current standard is the silver standard. The Boerc is based on the price for one gram of silver.
5.   If the Boerc at its current form, with His Majesty’s approval at anytime, with the aide from this act, can switch the standards as defined below.

STANDARDS

6.   The Boerc can be set as three one-thousandths of a troy ounce of gold, to be known as the gold-standard.
7.   The Boerc can be set as one one-thousandth of a troy ounce of platinum, to be known as the platinum-standard.
4.   The Boerc can be set as three one-thousandths of a troy ounce of palladium, to be known as the palladium-standard.
