CHAPTER 28 - AN ACT TO MODIFY REDESIGNATED ROUTE MARKERS WITHIN THE BAUSTRALIAN HIGHWAY SYSTEM TO FOLLOW AN ALTERNATE COLOUR SCHEME, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES CONNECTED THEREWITH

Be it enacted by His Most Gracious and Excellent Majesty, the following:-
1.   This Act shall be known as the Routes (Redesignations) Act, 2023, Bill T6121.
2.   As the Routes Office is designating new highways the numbers of former Baustralian highways, an alternate colour scheme was requested for redesignations.
3.   A cream coloured shield, with brown text shall be used for any redesignated highway numbers. When all old designations have been re-assigned, the white shield will be used.
