CHAPTER 2 - AN ACT TO ESTABLISH A NATIONAL ROUTE SYSTEM

Whereas it has been determined the current Baustralian route system is too complicated for the amount of routes contained within the country,
And whereas, the old system is laid out for the provincial system and does not transfer well to the county system,
Be it enacted by His Most Gracious Majesty, and with the Consent of the Current Commons assembled, after the destruction of the original Act, the following:
1.   This Act shall be known as the National Routes Act, c. 2.
2.   The current route system shall be reformed as such:
